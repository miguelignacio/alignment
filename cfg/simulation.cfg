# Simulation configuration

# NumberOfTracks: Number of tracks for which alignment is simulated
NumberOfTracks: 10000

# ParticleGenerator:
# Gun: Tracks with given momentum (see below) evenly distributed over whole
#      surface.
# Cosmic: Default. Tracks according to the cosmic muon spectrum at sea level.
#         Momentum distribution from hep-ph/0103322, angular distribution
#         cos^2 theta. 
#ParticleGenerator: Cosmic
ParticleGenerator: Gun

# Gun.Momentum: Momentum (in GeV) for the "Gun" particle generator
Gun.Momentum: 4

# Cosmic.MinimumEnergy: Minimum energy (in GeV) for particles generated with
# the "Cosmic" generator. Valid range is from 0. to 100. GeV
Cosmic.MinimumEnergy: 1

# DetectorResolution: If set to off, hit positions are computed with infinite
#                     precision. If set to uniform, hits are smeared by the
#                     detector resolution with a uniform distribution. If set
#                     to Gaus, hits are smeared with a gaussian
#                     distribution
DetectorResolution: Gaus

# MultipleScattering: If set to on, simulate multiple scattering effects
#                     while passing through the detector. Effects are
#                     calculated for muons only.
MultipleScattering: Off

# AlignmentDataFileName: The name of the file where the output of the simulation,
#                        reconstruction and tracking is stored. This file is the
#                        input to the alignment program
AlignmentDataFileName: alignment_data.root

# Reconstruction configuration

# MinimumNumberOfHits: The minimum number of hits in the detector before track
#                      parameters get calculated and the track is being used.
MinimumNumberOfHits: 3

# Alignment configuration

# PositionAlignmentError: 
#
# A value in mm representing the std deviation of the expected misalignment
# movement. It is the same value for all three movements. Default 1 mm / sqrt(12.)
PositionAlignmentError: 2.88675134594812921e-01

# RotationAlignmentError:
# A value in mrad representing the std deviation of the expected misalignment
# angle. It is the same value for all three angles. Default 50 mrad / sqrt(12).
RotationAlignmentError: 1.44337567297406454e-02

# LogLevel: How much detail will be printed on the screen. Higher numbers

# 2: Errors and warnings
