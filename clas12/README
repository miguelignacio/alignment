This folder contains scripts to perform the following tasks involved in clas12 CVT alignment:
1) filtering CLAS12 raw-data files to only include the events used for CLAS12 CVT alignment
2) running reconstruction on CLAS12 data
3) running the alignment on the reconstructed CLAS12 data
4) modifying the calibration-conditions database (ccdb) after alignment
5) creating diagnostic plots of the reconstruction and alignment performance.
6) Automating #2-#5 in an iterative process.  


Before running the scripts in this package, you will need the following software packages:
1) clas12-offline-software:  This package contains the code for reconstructing CLAS-12 data.  You will need to use the dev-align3 branch, which contains added functionality for extracting information needed for running alignment.  After downloading the project and checking out the correct branch, you will need to compile the package.  
# download the software
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/clas12-offline-software/
# checkout the dev-align3 branch (where the pre-alignment matrix-extraction is implemented)
cd clas12-offline-software
git checkout dev-align3
# build the package
./build-coatjava.sh
# add this line to your .bashrc, .cshrc, .bash_profile, or equivalent.  replace /path/to with the
# appropriate path to the clas12-offline-software installation directory.  In the example shown below,
# clas12-offline-software is in the home directory
export PATH=$PATH:~/clas12-offline-software/coatjava/bin

2)  ccdb:  calibration conditions database package for clas12
# check out package:
git clone git@github.com:JeffersonLab/ccdb.git ccdb
# add the following line to your ~/.bashrc (Linux) or ~/.bash_profile (MacOS) file:
source /path/to/ccdb/environment.bash

The initial ccdb conditions that I use are located on the JLab CUE system at /work/clas12/users/gotra/ccdb/clas12_cvtalign_maxime_05142020_6342.sqlite.
Copy this file to somewhere on your computer.  Then, add the following lines in your ~/.bashrc (Linux) or ~/.bash_profile (MacOS), modifying the username and file location accordingly:
export CCDB_CONNECTION=sqlite:////Users/spaul/clas12/sql/clas12_cvtalign_maxime_05142020_6342.sqlite
export CCDB_USER=spaul

Then run the following line of code in your console:
source ~/.bashrc # if you are using Linux
OR
source ~/.bash_profile # if you are using MacOS

3)  If you haven't already done so, compile Martin Weber's alignment code (one folder up from this one).  

4)  Finally, To compile the various utils in this folder (clas12) do the following:
./compile_clas12_cvt_utils.sh


To perform alignment:

First obtain the input files.  For the RGB spring 2019 run period, the runs needed for alignment are 6342 (field-off tracks from the target) and 6117 (cosmic tracks).  These (or the equivalent files from a different run group) need to be copied to the local machine, and then preprocessed.   The preprocessing includes
1) updating the hipo index to include banks defined in the dev-align3 branch of clas12-offline-software
2) running a preliminary reconstruction
3) filtering out events that are not relevant for CVT alignment
4) removing the preliminary reconstruction information.  

To preprocess a file, do the following commands
cd scripts/misc/
./preprocess.sh input.hipo output.hipo
(or "./preprocess.sh input.hipo output.hipo --cosmic" if the file is a cosmics data file)

One can alternatively use an evio file for input.


After preprocessing the files, you can then use these files for alignment.  Go to the "generic" scripts folder, where the scripts for running iterations of recon, KAA and ccdb updates can be found.  
cd scripts/generic

Then, copy the file ./iterate_for_paper.sh to another name
cp ./iterate_for_paper.sh ./iterate_custom.sh
Edit the file ./iterate_custom.sh and change the names of the input field-off and cosmic files used.  Other options can be edited as well.  

Below are the lines that should be modified, which set the locations of the files used for input and for the ccdb.  zf stands for "Zero [magnetic] field", and refers to the file with tracks from the target with the solenoid turned off.  To run reconstruction with only cosmics or only field-off tracks from the target, set the other input file name to be blank.  

export input_file_zf=$HOME/input_for_alignment/fieldoff_6342.hipo 
export input_file_cosmics=$HOME/input_for_alignment/cosmic_6117.hipo  
export CCDB_CONNECTION=sqlite:///$HOME/input_for_alignment/ccdb_2022-01-16.sqlite


Running ./iterate_custom.sh will begin the iterative process.   Folders with names plots_pass_1, etc will be created in the clas12/scripts/generic directory.  These will contain the reconstructed hipo files, the input file for the KAA, the output of the KAA, text files with the new alignment parameters, and a large number of diagnostic plots, produced in each iteration.  The final alignment parameters can be found in plot_pass_N/devN_bmt.txt and plot_pass_N/devN_svt.txt, where N is the number of iterations specified in the iteration script.
