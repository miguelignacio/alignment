# Detector layout
# 
# This layout is inspired by the Cosmic Rack.
#
# Number of layers
NLayer: 6
# Number of rods
NRod: 2
# Number of modules
NModule: 6
# distance between layers (mm)
LayerDistance: 86
# Randomly place modules. This is useful for debugging. If set to Off, all
# modules will be at their default location, i.e. all modules of one layer are
# in the same plane. If set to On, the detector is constructed with the
# modules tilted and moved. However, this is not a misalignment: The tilted
# and moved position will be used in the simulation of the tracks, as if the
# detector has been constructed on purpose to have non-planar modules.
RandomPlacement: On

# Misalignment  (values are in mm)
#
# The detectors are misaligned according to a uniform distribution.
# The range is between -value ... value for the specified values
# Position is in mm and Rotation is in rad

# this is a strong misalignment
MisalignPosition: 0.2
MisalignRotation: 0.005

# for an ideal detector, take the two lines below
#MisalignPosition: 0.
#MisalignRotation: 0.
