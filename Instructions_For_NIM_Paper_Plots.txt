Instructions for creating the plots for the NIM paper


PART 1:  Installing all software

0)  Make sure that ROOT, Java and python are installed on your computer.
1)  Install the clas12-offline-software package which contains the code for reconstructing CLAS12 data.  This may take a while to run, so start this first, and proceed with tasks 2-7 while waiting for the clas12-offline-software to compile
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/clas12-offline-software.git
cd clas12-offline-software
git checkout dev-align3  #special branch in which the recon includes additional output needed for alignment
./build-coatjava.sh
2) download the input folder:
cd ~
scp -r scigw.jlab.org:/work/clas12/spaul/input_for_alignment .
3) Install ccdb, 
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/ccdb/
4)  Change the first line of ccdb/bin/ccdb from "#!/usr/bin/env python2" to "#!/usr/bin/env python3".   
5) Add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file (~/.bash_profile on MacOS), and then run "source ~/.bashrc".
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/clas12-offline-software/coatjava/bin:$HOME/ccdb/bin/
export CCDB_CONNECTION=sqlite:///${HOME}/input_for_alignment/ccdb_2022-01-02-6342-devbs8.sqlite
6)  Add yourself as a user on the ccdb file
ccdb user --create $USER
7)  Follow the README in the alignment project for instructions to compile the KAA software.  It is unnecesary to install CLHEP, since it is only used by the the builtin "simulation" subpackage, which is not necessary for this project.
8) After step 1 is complete, compile the clas12-specific programs.  These utilities include converting hipo files from the recon output to root, parsing the KAA output in order to put new parameters into the ccdb, and creating diagnostic plots.  
cd alignment/clas12
./compile_clas12_cvt_utils.sh


PART 2:  Run iteration process:
cd clas12/scripts/generic/
# run the following script (this requires that  
./iterate_plots_for_paper.sh
#this will create folders plot_pass_#, which will contain the root and hipo output files, as well as diagnostic plots for each pass.
