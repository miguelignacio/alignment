to run the scripts in this folder, you will need the software packages:
1)  clas12-offline-software:
# contains the code for reconstructing CLAS-12 data
# download the software
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/clas12-offline-software/
# checkout the dev-align3 branch (where the pre-alignment matrix-extraction is implemented)
cd clas12-offline-software
git checkout dev-align3
# build the package
./build-coatjava.sh
# add this line to your .bashrc, .cshrc, .bash_profile, or equivalent.  replace /path/to with the
# appropriate path to the clas12-offline-software installation directory
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/clas12-offline-software/coatjava/binclas12-offline-software/coat-java
2)  ccdb:  calibration conditions database package for clas12
# check out package:
git clone git@github.com:JeffersonLab/ccdb.git ccdb
# add this to your .bashrc or equivalent:
source /path/to/ccdb/environment.bash

The initial ccdb conditions that I use are located on the JLab CUE system at /work/clas12/users/gotra/ccdb/clas12_cvtalign_maxime_05142020_6342.sqlite
Copy this to somewhere on your computer, and then put these lines in your .bashrc (modifying the username and location accordingly):
export CCDB_CONNECTION=sqlite:////Users/spaul/clas12/sql/clas12_cvtalign_maxime_05142020_6342.sqlite
export CCDB_USER=spaul

To compile the various utils in this folder do the following:
./compile_clas12_cvt_utils.sh


The input files can be found on the jlab cue system on the hblin4 computer at /storage/cvt/alignment/cosmic-runs (cosmic) and /storage/cvt/alignment/alignment-runs (field-off tracks from target).
Copy the files for runs 6342 (field-off) and 6117 (cosmics) to your computer.
Modify the script alignment/clas12/scripts/recon_and_filter.sh to use the correct file locations where your input files are located.  This script will create a skimmed version of the files, so that the recon part of the alignment cycle will run much faster.  When running this on cosmic files, make sure to modify the recon_for_filter.yaml to set 'cosmics: "true"'.

The folder alignment/clas12/scripts/generic contains scripts for running cycles of event reconstruction, KAA, and CCDB updates.  These are all based on iterate.sh, and use environmental variables to specify which parts of the CLAS12 CVT and which alignment variables to align at any given stage.  A full description of this folder is found in alignment/clas12/scripts/generic/README
