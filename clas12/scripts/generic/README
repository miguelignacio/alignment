#  the iterate.sh script runs multiple iterations of the following cycle:

#  1) CLAS-12 CVT reconstruction and matrix extraction (for KAA input)
#  2) Creating plots relating to the input for the KAA (created with alignment/clas12/cvt_plots/CVTPlotsPre)
#  3) Running KAA
#  4) Creating plots corresponding to the output of the KAA (created with alignment/clas12/cvt_plots/CVTPlotsPost)
#  5) Run KAA's validation
#  6) Update the CCDB

# use export variableName=value for the following variables before running iterate.sh:

# variables needed for the ccdb:
# location where the ccdb software is installed
export CCDB_HOME=/Users/spaul/ccdb
# username for ccdb
export CCDB_USER=spaul
# location of the local sqlite file for the ccdb (preceded by sqlite:///)
export CCDB_CONNECTION=sqlite:////Users/spaul/clas12/sql/clas12_cvtalign_maxime_05142020_6342.sqlite

#recompile the clas12-offline-software package before running KFA iterations?
export recompile=false
#maximum iteration number (ie, number of cycles to run)
export maxiter=6
#start KAA iterations with the following initial variation of the calibration constants
export initial_var=rga_fall2018_svtsurvey
# which set of alignment variables should be used?  Tx=translations in x, Rx=rotations in x, etc.
export config=TxTy
# number of files to use
export n=1000
#name of alignment config file (in the cfg folder)
export align_cfg=align_bmtz_TxTy.cfg
# input file for field-off tracks from the target
export input_file_zf=/Users/spaul/alignment/clas12/scripts/misc/filtered.hipo
# input file for cosmic tracks (this will be added to the script later).
export input_file_cosmics=/Users/spaul/alignment/clas12/scripts/misc/filtered_cosmics.hipo

# now you can run the iterate.sh script!  
./iterate.sh
